Power Flow
==========


Import "sys" so the report can be written to stdout. 
::

  import sys

Import the logging module 
::

  import logging

and set up a basic configuration. 
::

  logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stdout, level=logging.DEBUG)

The "pylon" package contains classes for defining a power system model and
power flow solvers. 
::

  from pylon import \
      Case, Bus, Branch, Generator, NewtonPF, FastDecoupledPF, REFERENCE

Start by building up a one branch case with two generators 
::

  bus1 = Bus(type=REFERENCE)
  g1 = Generator(bus1, p=80.0, q=10.0)

and fixed load at the other. 
::

  bus2 = Bus(p_demand=60.0, q_demand=4.0)
  g2 = Generator(bus2, p=20.0, q=0.0)

Connect the two buses 
::

  line = Branch(bus1, bus2, r=0.05, x=0.01)

and add it all to a new case. 
::

  case = Case(buses=[bus1, bus2], branches=[line], generators=[g1, g2])

Choose to solve using either Fast Decoupled method 
::

  solver = FastDecoupledPF(case)

or Newton's method 
::

  solver = NewtonPF(case)

and then call the solver. 
::

  solver.solve()

Write the case out to view the results. 
::

  case.save_rst(sys.stdout)
